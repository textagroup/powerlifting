## CDPA Records

A SilverStripe project to store the CDPA powerlifting records.

The admin section will contain model admins to manage Affiliations, Competiitions,
Lifters, Weight/Age classes, regions and results.

The front end will display simple tables of the records and allow csv files of the records to be downloaded.

The idea is for the project to be used for data entry of competiiton results and the records should be updated automatically.

## TODO

PHPUnit tests would be good

A task to check results from openpowerlifting and notify of corrections or updates
